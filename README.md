# View-Remaster
For this project, I made a View-Master Reel scanner. 
I call it the View-Remaster. In short, this will scan in 3D View-Master reels and create a side-by-side (SBS) video that I can upload to YouTube.

I've been wanting to do this project for a VERY long time. So I'm excited to share it with you.

The channel that the video are uploading to are here:
